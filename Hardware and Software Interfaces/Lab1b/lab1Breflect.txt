1. Benefits are being able to store 256 items instead of 10 in each section allowing for many more operations, accessing the number of items in a section is much easier,
as it doesn't require bitwise operations such as shifting and much more in order to get the empty spaces or filled spaces. With a value, it would be easier to do simple math to figure out the 
number of empty and filled spots. Another benefit is having more of a variety of items due to the item id being up to 256 instead of 64 as well. This
representation allows for many items in the store and keeping track of each item and their inventory much easier.
One drawback of this new representation is not being able to learn bitwise operations and manipulating binary representation and values as the previous 
representation was able to teach us how to manipulate certain binary values, but the new representation would take away those neccessary functions that we 
are needed to learn.
2a. signed int
b. int
The difference in signed int and int is in the range of values that is has. Signed int goes from -2147483648 to 2147483647, but int goes from 0 to 4294967295.
The amount of values are the same as they are both 4 byte varible sizes, however, the range of these values are different as one is signed and one is unsigned.
3. a = 4194305.000000, b = 8388609.000000, c= 16777216.0000
The values of a, b, and c are like that because when shifting 1 < 22 or 23 or 24 times, it is basically saying 2^23, or 2^24, or 2^22. These values
are the decimal value of (float) 1 < 22, 23, 24. As a result, since a size of a float is 4 bytes, these values don't exceed the float range and is 1 + 2^22 for a and same for b and c.
