# UW Embedded Systems Coursework and Projects
Computer Science Engineering Coursework at the University of Washington regarding embedded systems, hardware/software interfaces, and programming in C/C++

**Introduction to Embedded Systems:**
Embedded systems coursework at the University of Washington, imposing a battery management system in C/C++ on a Arduino ATMega2560. Each lab in the coursework progresses upon each other, updating functionalities as well as implementation methods. Using a modern embedded microcomputer, acquired knowledge in TCBS/Scheduling, Kernels, Interrupts, Resource Sharing, Deadlocks, and concepts dealing with specification, design, development, and testing of real-time embedded systems software.

**Hardware and Software Interfaces:**
Coursework examines computational abstraction levels underneath modern high-level languages, assembly language, introduction to C, memory management, OS processing models, high-level machine architecture, memory hierarchy, implementation of high-level languages. Each lab, programming in C, demonstrate an understanding and knowledge in concepts described above, related to abstraction levels of high-level languages.

**Intermediate Programming Concepts and Tools:**
Covers concepts of design, implementation, and testing of low-level programming (C/C++), explicit memory management, and Linux bash commands.
